This is a Rust implementation of a self-hostable server implementation for TRMNL displays.

It is still early days and more a first draft.
## Currently supported plugins

- Github Commit Graph

## Configuration
A schedule is configurable with a config file. eg:

```yaml
default_screen:
  !githubcommitgraph

schedules:
  - screen: "GithubDay"
    start_time: "08:00"
    end_time: "16:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      !githubcommitgraph
  - screen: "GithubNight"
    start_time: "16:00"
    end_time: "23:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      !staticimage
        path: "./data/peter.bmp"
  - screen: "Screen3"
    start_time: "23:00"
    end_time: "08:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      !custom
          template: |
            <div>
              <h1>Welcome to Screen 3</h1>
              <p>This is a custom HTML template for Screen 3.</p>
            </div>
          plugin_code: |  # Ruby content code
            def custom_content
              # Your Ruby code here
              "This content is generated by Ruby code."
            end

plugin_config:
  githubcommitgraph:
    username: "lukas-heiligenbrunner"
    api_key: "<your_key>"

devices:
  - name: "Device1"
    mac_address: "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
    token: "42424242"
```

If schdules overlap the first time match is used.
