# BYOS_rs

This is a Rust implementation of a self-hostable server implementation for TRMNL displays.

It is still early days and more a first draft.
## Currently supported plugins

- Github Commit Graph

more to come...

## Configuration
A schedule is configurable with a config file. eg:

```yaml
default_screen:
  plugin_type: githubcommitgraph

schedules:
  - screen: "GithubDay"
    start_time: "08:00"
    end_time: "16:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      plugin_type: githubcommitgraph
  - screen: "GithubNight"
    start_time: "16:00"
    end_time: "23:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      plugin_type: githubcommitgraph
  - screen: "Screen3"
    start_time: "23:00"
    end_time: "08:00"
    update_interval: 600
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
    plugin:
      name: "custom"  # Plugin to use for displaying the screen
      template: |
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to Screen 3</h1>
          <p>This is a custom HTML template for Screen 3.</p>
        </div>
      plugin_code: |  # Ruby content code
        def custom_content
          # Your Ruby code here
          "This content is generated by Ruby code."
        end

plugin_config:
  githubcommitgraph:
    username: "lukas-heiligenbrunner"
    api_key: "<your_key>"
```

If schdules overlap the first time match is used.
